# TimerQuiz
A timer based quiz web application

TimerQuiz is a timer based quiz web application designed for college based competitive time limited quizzes. 
It works in the following manner:
1. Admin access is given to quiz organisers to upload the questions along with their options (the correct answer is also uploaded).
2. Participants can login with a user ID and their names. They need to answer the questions within the specified time frame.
3. After the participant finishes the quiz, his score is generated.
4. The leaderboard can also be viewed. 

TimerQuiz is made with React.js on the frontend and Django on the backend. 

Please check the screenshots section to view sample images of the application.
